= Logstash

The Logstash project from https://www.elastic.co/[Elastic] provides for a centralized server to accumulate logs from a multitude of applications.  WildFly Swarm makes it easy to have each of your applications or services dump their logs into it.

== Configure

=== Dependency
To add Logstash integration to your WildFly Swarm application, you need to add a dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>logstash</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

=== Configuration

While the above dependency adds the capability of logging to Logstash, until the Logstash server's hostname and port is set, the integration remains inactive.

To configure _where_ the Logstash server is running, the following two properties need to be set, either through plugin configuration or on the command-line using `-D...`
