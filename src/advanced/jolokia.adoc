= Jolokia

https://jolokia.org/[Jolokia] is a small utility which provides a JSON-based JMX connector over HTTP.  WildFly Swarm supports a simple method for adding Jolokia to your application.


== Adding Jolokia

To bring Jolokia to your application, you need to add a dependency on the Jolokia fraction:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>jolokia</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

This is sufficient to bind an unsecured Jolokia to the context root of `/jolokia`.

If you would like to configure where Jolokia is mounted, you can override the defaults within your `main(...)` method:

[source,java]
----
Container container = new Container();
container.fraction( 
    new JolokiaFraction("/jmx")
);
----

The above would make Jolokia available at the path of ```/jmx```.

Adding the Jolokia fraction to your application will bring in the Undertow fraction implicitly if you have not already included it.
